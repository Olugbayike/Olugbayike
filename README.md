## 😁 Hi there 👋 I am Olugbayike A., and I am passionate and commited to turning complex problems into simple software solutions. 😁

## About Me
I believe everyone is an artist, some use paint brushes, some use words, some use rulers and dimensions, I use 0's and 1's, i.e., I express myself through code. Inspiration is a beautiful thing so I plan to showcase my projects or neigh I say pieces as I continue to grow. A detailed information/documentation on my repos can be found through links on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olugbayike-ade-onojobi)

Furthermore, I have some projects I call dream (sueño) projects like Symphony which will remain private repositories but information about them will be posted on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olugbayike-ade-onojobi).

🤞 I am also open to collaborations as I would love to one day work with the greats in the field of computer science and hopefully, be mentioned along side them. 🤞 Collaborators could contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olugbayike-ade-onojobi).
